OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:
-It is the project of password generating.
-The `generate_password()` function is defined to generate a random password based on the user-specified length. It combines letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and punctuation to create a secure password.
-The main window of the application is created using `tk.Tk()` and titled "Password Generator".
-A label and an entry field are created for the user to input the desired length of the password. The label asks the user to enter the password length, and the entry field allows the user to input the desired length.
-A button labeled "Generate Password" is created. When clicked, this button triggers the `generate_password()` function to generate a password based on the specified length.
-Another label and entry field are created to display the generated password to the user.
-The application is run using `root.mainloop()`, which starts the GUI and keeps it running until the user closes the window.
